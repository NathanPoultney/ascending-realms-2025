ou can programmatically fill in shapes of the sprites with a color dynamically by using shader effects or surface manipulation. Here's a basic approach using surface manipulation, which is straightforward and doesn't require the complexity of shaders.

Step 1: Create a Mask for the Team Color
You need a separate image (a "mask") for each sprite where the areas you want to color dynamically are filled with a specific color (like white), and everything else is transparent. This mask will be used to determine which parts of the sprite should be colored.

Step 2: Create the Dynamic Coloring Function
You can create a function that draws the original sprite and then draws the mask on top, using a blend mode to color the mask.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might code this:

gml
Copy code
// Assume you have these assets:
// - spr_unit_base: The base sprite without any team color
// - spr_unit_mask: The mask sprite that has white where the team color should be

// Function to draw the unit with a dynamic team color
function DrawUnitWithTeamColor(x, y, base_sprite, mask_sprite, team_color) {
    // Draw the base sprite first
    draw_sprite(base_sprite, 0, x, y);

    // Set the blend mode to multiply so the white parts of the mask get colored
    draw_set_blend_mode(bm_multiply);

    // Set the drawing color to the team's color
    draw_set_color(team_color);

    // Draw the mask sprite on top
    draw_sprite(mask_sprite, 0, x, y);

    // Reset the blend mode and color
    draw_set_blend_mode(bm_normal);
    draw_set_color(c_white);
}

// Example usage in a Draw event
DrawUnitWithTeamColor(x, y, spr_unit_base, spr_unit_mask, make_color_rgb(255, 0, 0)); // Red team color
Step 3: Use the Function in Your Game
You can call this function whenever you need to draw a unit or building with a specific team color. This approach allows you to dynamically change the team color without needing multiple versions of the sprite.

Considerations:
Performance: This method is generally efficient, but if you have many units, using surfaces or shaders might be more optimized for performance.
Precision: The method depends on how well the mask is designed. If the mask is too detailed, it might require more precise positioning.
This approach gives you flexibility and reduces the workload of creating multiple sprite variations for each team color.
